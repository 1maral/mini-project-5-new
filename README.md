**Notes for the reader**

This project implements a system for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, enabling individuals with speech impairments to communicate through symbols converted into spoken language. The *AACCategory* class manages categories by mapping images to text, while the *AACMapping* class handles all mappings, including category selection, adding items, and resetting to the home screen. The constructor reads from a file to create these mappings, while methods like *addItem* and *select* manage our navigation inside the system. 
Testing for this project was successfully done through a library help from my classmate, Khanh Do.
